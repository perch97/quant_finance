1. Portfolio_Risk_Management_Monte_Carlo

Monte Carlo simulation is a method that uses random sampling and statistical modeling to estimate complex phenomena or predict future outcomes. 
In the context of this code, it is being used to simulate portfolio returns and assess the risk metrics (VaR and CVaR) based on simulated data.

2. Portfolio_Risk_Management_Historical_Sim_Method

The Historical Method for assessing Value at Risk (VaR) is one of the simplest and most intuitive approaches to estimating potential losses in a portfolio over a specified time horizon, given the historical price data. It relies purely on the actual past returns of assets or a portfolio, without making any assumptions about the underlying distribution of returns.
